# What the hell is this?
It's a program that translates a message into H's.

# Why?
Because I can.

# How does it work?
Use the "e" argument to encode and the "d" argument to decode.
The input for encode cannot contain anything other than the 26 letters of the English alphabet.
```
./h e "MESSAGE"
./h d "HhHHhHhHhhHHhhHHHhhHHhhhhHHHhhHhHhh"
```
